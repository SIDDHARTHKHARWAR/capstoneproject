# Automated testing is being done on the capstone project.
To provide a framework for testing the Sporty Shoes website


Synopsis of the Issue and Current Situation:
 Sporty Shoes is the name of the website, which includes several features.  For the task, I utilized https://neemans.com/.
• The user may effortlessly view the products; I've included some features for that as well.
• Users can add several goods to their cart and complete the checkout process. • If they want to check and buy something, they can first sign up and then log in. 
• A dashboard is available for them to view, edit, and examine their cart as well as previous purchase histories.
Upon completing the checkout process, users' cart contents are removed, and an order is created and saved in their order history. The program mentioned above is now operational. The next step is to include a testing layer to make sure everything makes it past quality assurance.

Task: The testing framework creation is outlined in the following tasks:

1 To add a REST API module, add further code to the initial project. There will be two API endpoints for this module: 2 Get the list of every item in the store; • Get the list of every user who has signed up.
3 Make Selenium scripts to test every page of the website application.
4 Test each and every backend class and method using unit tests.
5 Write JMeter scripts to test the load on the homepage.




How to execute :
1.	Import the project in eclipse IDE
2.	Identify testNG.xml
3.	Run testNG.xml
4.	Open the jmiter file provide there and run it .
